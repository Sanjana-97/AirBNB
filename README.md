## 📌 Business Insights

-  **Entire homes/apartments dominate the market** (82% of listings), making it the preferred room type for guests.
-  **Average listing price is $289.78**, but most listings fall below $400, indicating a price-sensitive customer base.
-  **Top hosts like Blueground and Tigran manage hundreds of listings**, suggesting commercial-scale operations.
-  **Highly rated listings are not always high-priced**, implying guest satisfaction is driven by value, not cost.
-  **Chicago contributes slightly more listings (54%)** than New Orleans (46%).
